## Notes
To access course materials for weeks 2+3 on ipython notebook (Google Colab Notebook): 
1. Open the link to Google Drive. It is named as 'cfr_bootcamp'. <br>
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f_v3VJ2Y82Mtdnfwe6x_Spvji-YXFIET?usp=sharing <br>
You will have that folder on your local Google Drive, and can access data there. <br>

2. Go to local Google Drive and create a new folder 'my_bootcamp'. Copy Day*.ipynb from (cfr_bootcamp) to your own folder (my_bootcamp). Then proceed to open the copy from your own directory (my_bootcamp). 

3. Then run the first few blocks. It will prompt you to mount your own drive to colab working directory.  <br>
*Go to this URL in a browser: (Some link here)* <br>
It will open another window to choose an account that you wish to link to Colab Notebook. Copy the authorization code it gives you and input to the blank space below: <br>
*Enter your authorization code:* <br>
